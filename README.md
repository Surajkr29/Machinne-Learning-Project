**Student Performance Predictor for EduQuest Coaching**

_**"Student Performance Predictor"**_ 

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model that predicts student academic performance based on various factors, including past academic records, attendance, engagement in coursework, and demographic information. The system will enable EduQuest Coaching to identify students who may require additional support, tailor educational interventions, and ultimately improve student success rates and retention.
